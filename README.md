## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

The biggest takeaway for me was the use of SASS to speed up the CSS/styling creation process.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to learn more about SASS and also other CSS pre-processors.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Docs](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - This helped me understand the basics of Sass and get me going right away.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - For some of the basic HTML/CSS stuff I forgot like fitting the QR code within the contents of the `<div>`.
